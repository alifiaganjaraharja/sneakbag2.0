By Alifia Ganjaraharja

## Project Overview: 
1. **Goal**: Analyze Shoe laundry & services (Sneakbag) on 3 months revenue, and find out the trend on how Holiday and precipitation (rainy day) affect the overall revenue, transactions, and customers to optimize operational efficiency. 
2. **Dataset**: The Dataset used for this project was from the previous analysis where i retrieved the daily, weekly, and monthly transaction from their daily transactions system or app named Hui manually to the Google Sheet combine with the weather data to gather the precipitation data within the Bandung area from meteostat website. The dataset provides comprehensive insights into the operation and revenue performance of Sneakbag, a Shoe laundry and services company, throughout 2023 for the first three months. The dataset contains columns such as Date, Month, Weekday, Precipitation, Holiday, Revenue, Total Customers, Total Items, and Total Transactions.
3. **Tools Used**: SQL (For data extraction & aggregation), Python (Pandas, seaborn, and Matplotlib) for analysis & Visualization.

## Hypothesis
This analysis is an extension of my previous project with Sneakbag. I incorporated additional data, such as precipitation, to gather information about the weather, specifically rainy days. I also aimed to find out whether there is a significant correlation between rainy days and overall revenue and transactions during the three months of June, July, and August 2023. This analysis may also reveal patterns or spikes in revenue and transactions that occur after a rainy day.
