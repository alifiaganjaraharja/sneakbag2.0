# Sneakbag 2.0: A deep-dive analysis of three months of revenue, combined with holiday and precipitation data.
By Alifia Ganjaraharja

## Project Overview: 
1. **Goal**: Analyze Shoe laundry & services (Sneakbag) on 3 months revenue, and find out the trend on how Holiday and precipitation (rainy day) affect the overall revenue, transactions, and customers to optimize operational efficiency. 
2. **Dataset**: The Dataset used for this project was from the previous analysis where i retrieved the daily, weekly, and monthly transaction from their daily transactions system or app named Hui manually to the Google Sheet combine with the weather data to gather the precipitation data within the Bandung area from meteostat website. The dataset provides comprehensive insights into the operation and revenue performance of Sneakbag, a Shoe laundry and services company, throughout 2023 for the first three months. The dataset contains columns such as Date, Month, Weekday, Precipitation, Holiday, Revenue, Total Customers, Total Items, and Total Transactions.
3. **Tools Used**: SQL (For data extraction & aggregation), Python (Pandas, seaborn, and Matplotlib) for analysis & Visualization.

## Hypothesis:
This analysis is an extension of my previous project with Sneakbag. I incorporated additional data, such as precipitation, to gather information about the weather, specifically rainy days. I also aimed to find out whether there is a significant correlation between rainy days and overall revenue and transactions during the three months of June, July, and August 2023. This analysis may also reveal patterns or spikes in revenue and transactions that occur after a rainy day.

| **Hypothesis**                                         | 
|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Holiday VS Non-Holiday                              | 
| 2. Rainy Day Vs Dry                                    | 
| 3. Correlation between Rainy days with overall revenue |                             
| 4. Pattern of revenue after rainy day                  | 
| 5. Weekday Performance                                 |

## Result and Findings

1. Holiday VS. Non-Holiday

| **Holiday**             | **Average Revenue**         | **Average Transaction**        | **Average Customer**       |  
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------|
| 0                       | 325930.23                   | 5.0                            | 3.0                        |
| 1                       | 275000.0                    | 5.0                            | 3.0                        |

While there is no difference in the average transaction value and customer count between holidays and non-holidays, there is a slight difference in average revenue, with non-holidays generating more revenue. This suggests that opening the store during holidays does not significantly improve revenue, transactions, or customer count.

2. Rainy Day VS. Dry

| **WeatherType**         | **Average Revenue**         | **Average Transaction**        | **Average Customer**       |  
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Dry                     | 324696.97                   | 5.0                            | 4.0                        |
| Rainy                   | 321440.68                   | 5.0                            | 3.0                        |

From this result, although the difference in numbers is slight, it’s evident that dry days generated more revenue than rainy days. This suggests that my hypothesis about rainy days being correlated with overall revenue may not be valid. To gain a clearer understanding, I’ll present the correlation coefficient results next.

3. Correlation between Rainy days with overall revenue

| **CorrelationRainRevenue**                             | 
|--------------------------------------------------------|
| -0.0054652591939022138                                 | 

Now, it is getting more clearer from here that there is no significant relation between Rainy day with Revenue since the result showing -0.00546. It means that the relationship between Rainy day with Revenue is very weak negative correlation. However, there might be another pattern of revenue spikes after rainy days, so I conducted an additional analysis to explore that.

4. Pattern of revenue after rainy day

| **RainLagLabel**          | **NumDays**         | **Average Revenue**        | 
|---------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| Day After Rain (1-day lag)| 59                  | 295762.71                  | 
| Day After Rain (2-day lag)| 13                  | 293846.15                  | 
| Day After Rain (3-day lag)| 7                   | 366428.57                  | 
| Not After Rain            | 13                  | 449615.38                  | 

From this result, the spike in revenue occurs on Day 3 after rain, reaching an average of IDR 366,428, which is IDR 72,582 higher than the day before (Day 2 after rain).

This marks the highest average revenue among the three post-rain days. Although rainy days don't appear to immediately affect revenue, this pattern may suggest a delayed response — where customers postpone visits and return a few days later.

That said, the highest overall revenue still occurs on days not following recent rain, indicating that dry weather remains most favorable for business activity.

5. Weekday Performance

Lastly, I wanted to find out which day perform better with generating
